I am a neuroscientist studying how our ability to learn and use what we learned to make decisions develops throughout adolescence. I am currently a doctoral student in the [Meyer Lab](https://www.meyerlabneuro.com/) I received my B.A. in Psychology from The University of Texas at San Antonio, where I worked with [Dr. Alicia Swan](https://www.swanlab.org/) modeling the development of anxiety disorders and [Dr. Anthony Burgos-Robles](https://www.utsa.edu/sciences/neuroscience-developmental-regenerative-biology/faculty/AnthonyBurgosRobles.html)  researching the circuitry underlying affective regulation and active avoidance. I am interested in studying how the circuitry underlying the inhibition of reward-seeking behavior develops from adolescence into adulthood and how adolescents learn and come to make informed decisions when faced with conflicting stimuli. I am interested in using fiber photometry to study the role of inhibitory interneurons in adolescent learning and decision-making. Outside the lab, I enjoy cooking, weight-lifting, and playing table-top and video games. I greatly enjoy volunteering my spare time to STEM outreach opportunities. I am also unapologetically goth, a cat mom, and a lifelong lover of the horror genre.
